# CodeAlpha_TO-DO-LIST-APPLICATION.

To-Do List Application
A simple console-based to-do list application implemented in C++ using classes, dynamic memory allocation (DMA), and basic input handling. This application allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed, and view their current tasks.

Features
Add a task with a description.
Mark a task as completed.
View all tasks with their status (Completed/Incomplete).
Handle invalid user inputs gracefully.
Requirements
C++ Compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC)
Basic knowledge of C++ concepts such as classes, pointers, dynamic memory allocation, and input handling.
Compilation and Execution
1. Compile the Code
To compile the code, open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

g++ -o todo todo.cpp
This will compile the code into an executable named todo.

2. Run the Program
Once the code is compiled, run the program using the following command:
./todo

3. Interact with the Application
The program will display a menu with the following options:

1. Add Task: Allows you to add a task with a description.
2. Mark Task as Completed: Allows you to mark a specific task as completed.
3. View Tasks: Displays all tasks with their completion status.
4. Exit: Exits the program.
